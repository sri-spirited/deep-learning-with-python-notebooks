# Companion Jupyter notebooks for Frnacois Chollet's book "Deep Learning with Python"

This repo implements the code from [Deep Learning with Python (Manning Publications)](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python?a_aid=keras&a_bid=76564dff). I have added several notes and additional experiments and textbooks on top of the existing notebooks.

These notebooks use Python 3.6 and Keras 2.4.3. They were generated Google Collaboratory.
